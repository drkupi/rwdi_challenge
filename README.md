# Orbital Stack (RWDI) Programming Challenge
[![Challenge tests Actions Status](https://github.com/drkupi/rwdi_challenge/workflows/main-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drkupi/rwdi_challenge/actions)

## Overview
This repository includes by solution set for the Orbital Stack (RWDI) employment programming challenge. I have successfully completed 17 challenge questions with code logic for all challenge questions provided in challenge_solutions.py python file.

## How to re-run challenge scripts
The python file test_solutions.py includes all tests conducted to successfully run the challenge question codes. Moreover the test scripts are incorporated into a CI framework using github actions and workflows. The ci.yml within the workflows subfolder automates testing on Python 3.7-3.9. The only external python libraries used in coding are pytest and flake8. 

## Function Naming conventions
All challenge solution functions (in challenge_solutions.py) are labeled as "question_X" or "question_X_bonus", where X denotes day number (see https://adventofcode.com) and "bonus" refers to part 2 of the given day number.
